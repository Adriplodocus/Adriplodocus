## ✨ A bit more about me
I’ve been hooked on gaming since I was a kid — started with Atari 2600 and NES, but the original PlayStation is what really got me hooked. After that, games like Sekiro, Lineage II, and Final Fantasy X left a big mark and sparked my curiosity about how these worlds are made.

My goal? Keep learning, build games that excite people, and join teams that share this same passion.
